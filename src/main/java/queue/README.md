## Queue

A queue data structure is based on the principle of **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** since the first element to inserted
would be the first element removed.

You can understand a queue as a line of customers waiting for scarce resource, such as line waiting to buy ticket to an
event, or anywhere you may have ever seen a "queue" formed in real-life. The word itself if _British_ for _line_(the type
of line you have to wait in).

Operating Systems make extensive use of queues. One application being managing process execution.
In a modern operating system, several processes may be executing at the same time and, therefore, may request
the same computer resource (for example, the CPU, the GPU, or a printer). The operating system stores these types of 
requests in a queue and then removes them so that the process is waiting the longest will be the next one ot get access 
to the desired resource.
